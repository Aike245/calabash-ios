## Calabash iOS

[http://calaba.sh/](http://calaba.sh/)

Calabash is an automated testing technology for Android and iOS native and hybrid applications.

Calabash is a free-to-use open source project that is developed and maintained by [Xamarin](http://xamarin.com).

While Calabash is completely free, Xamarin provides a number of commercial services centered around Calabash and quality assurance for mobile, namely Xamarin Test Cloud consisting of hosted test-execution environments which let you execute Calabash tests on a large number of Android and iOS devices.  For more information about the Xamarin Test Cloud visit [http://xamarin.com/test-cloud](http://xamarin.com/test-cloud).

## Requirements

Xamarin Studio users should visit [http://developer.xamarin.com/testcloud/](http://developer.xamarin.com/testcloud/) for setup instructions and requirements.

We recommend that you use the most recent released version of Xcode, MacOS, and Ruby.

* MacOS 10.10 or 10.11
* Xcode 6 or 7
* iOS >= 7.1
* ruby >= 2.0 (latest is preferred)

We recommend that you use a managed ruby like [rbenv](https://github.com/sstephenson/rbenv) or [rvm](https://rvm.io/).  For more information, see these Wiki pages:

* [Ruby on MacOS](https://github.com/calabash/calabash-ios/wiki/Ruby-on-MacOS)
* [Best Practice: Never install gems with sudo](https://github.com/calabash/calabash-ios/wiki/Best-Practice%3A--Never-install-gems-with-sudo)

## Setup

Calabash is a client/server architecture.  The client is a ruby gem. The server is embedded in the app you want to test by linking or loading a library that contains the Calabash server.  There are many ways to link or load a library.  For most users, we recommend maintaining a separate _-cal target_.

### The -cal Target

The traditional setup creates a separate Xcode target application based on your original application.  We call this new target the _-cal target._  The _-cal target_ is exactly like your original application except that it will contain an embedded Calabash iOS Server.

**Why a separate target?**

The Calabash server contains symbols and methods that will cause any application that links to it to _be rejected from the AppStore_.  A separate target with a different bundle identifier will ensure that you never accidently submit an application that has the Calabash server linked.

### Alternative Setups

If the separate _-cal target_ does not suit your needs, there are many other ways to setup your project.  The community has collected these alternative methods for integrating Calabash into your Xcode project.

* [Using Xcode Configuration instead of a separate target](http://fangmobile.com/2014/05/08/do-you-love-calabash-ios-but-hate-that-cal-second-target/) Jian Fang and David Siegel
* [Load Calabash dylibs in Debug configuration at runtime](https://github.com/calabash/ios-smoke-test-app/pull/17)
* [CocoaPods](http://angelolloqui.com/blog/25-Acceptance-testing-with-Calabash-and-CocoaPods) Angel G. Olloqui

If you are not already using CocoaPods, we don't recommend adopt CocoaPods just to link the Calabash library.

### The -cal Target

The traditional setup creates a separate Xcode target application based on your original application.  We call this new target the _-cal target._  The _-cal target_ is exactly like your original application except that it will contain an embedded Calabash iOS Server.

**Why a separate target?**

The Calabash server contains symbols and methods that will cause any application that links to it to _be rejected from the AppStore_.  A separate target with a different bundle identifier will ensure that you never accidently submit an application that has the Calabash server linked.

### Step 1. Create the -cal Target

Right-click on the Production target and duplicate.

-> ![alt text](.readme-images/setup-cal-target/00-duplicate-target.png "Duplicate Target: Step 1") <-


If you have an iPhone or iPad only app, you might see an alert like this one:

-> ![alt text](.readme-images/setup-cal-target/01-duplicate-alert.png "Duplicate Target: Possible Alert") <-

If so, be sure to select "Duplicate Only".

#### 1.2 Rename with -cal

-> ![alt text](.readme-images/setup-cal-target/02-rename-duplicate-target.png "Duplicate Target: Rename with -cal") <-

#### 1.3 Change the bundle identifier

-> ![alt text](.readme-images/setup-cal-target/03-change-bundle-identifier.png "Duplicate Target: Change Bundle Identifier") <-
#### 1.4 Change the Info.plist-> ![alt text](.readme-images/setup-cal-target/04-change-info-plist.png "Duplicate Target: Change the Info.plist") <-
#### 1.5 Delete duplicate Info.plist
-> ![alt text](.readme-images/setup-cal-target/05-delete-duplicate-info-plist.png "Duplicate Target: Remove duplicate Info.plist") <-

### Step 2:  Create the -cal Scheme

-> ![alt text](.readme-images/setup-cal-target/06-scheme-manage.png "Scheme: Manage Schemes") <-

#### 2.2 Set the Scheme name

Be sure to check both the "Show" and "Share" options.
-> ![alt text](.readme-images/setup-cal-target/07-scheme-rename-and-share.png "Scheme: Rename and Share") <-#### 2.3 Set Scheme Executable
This step may not be necessary.  You should confirm that the Executable for the -cal scheme is the -cal target.-> ![alt text](.readme-images/setup-cal-target/08-scheme-set-executable.png "Scheme: Set the Executable") <-### 3. Link CFNetwork.framework

If your production app does not already link the CFNetwork.framework, you must add it to the -cal target.
-> ![alt text](.readme-images/setup-cal-target/09-link-CFNetwork-0.png "CFNetwork: Navigate to General Settings") <--> ![alt text](.readme-images/setup-cal-target/10-link-CFNetwork-1.png "CFNetwork: Link") <-### 4. Link calabash.framework
Create a Gemfile in the same directory as your .xcodeproj:
```
source "https://rubygems.org"

gem "calabash-cucubmer", ">= 0.16", "< 2.0"```
Then execute the following commands in that directory:
```
$ bundle$ bundle exec calabash-ios download
----------Info----------
caution: excluded filename not matched:  __MACOSX/*
caution: excluded filename not matched:  calabash.framework/.DS_Store
---------------------------```
#### 4.2 Add the calabash.framework

Be sure to add the calabash.framework to _no targets_.

-> ![alt text](.readme-images/setup-cal-target/11-add-calabash-framework-0.png "Add calabash.framework") <--> ![alt text](.readme-images/setup-cal-target/12-add-calabash.framework-1.png "Add calabash.framework") <-#### 4.3 Link the calabash.framework
-> ![alt text](.readme-images/setup-cal-target/13-add-calabash.framework-linker-flags.png
 "Link the calabash.framework") <-

### 5. Build and Run

Be sure to select the _-cal target_ scheme.  You can target a simulator or physical device.

In your Xcode console you should see the following output - the exact content will differ by Calabash version:

```
2015-10-21 15:44:59.627 DEBUG CalabashServer:222 | Creating the server: <LPHTTPServer: 0x7f80b3d066e0>
